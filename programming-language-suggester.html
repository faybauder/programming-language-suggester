  <h1>Welcome To Programming</h1>
    <p>There are many languages to programming to learn and can seem daunting to choose which direction to go in. Here I have created a short survey that can help you decide on the right fit for you!</p>
    <p>The three languages I will be suggesting are Python, Ruby, and Javascript. Here is a short description for all:
      <ul>
        <li>Python is commonly used for developing websites and software, task automation, data analysis, and data visualization. Since it’s relatively easy to learn, Python has been adopted by many non-programmers such as accountants and scientists, for a variety of everyday tasks, like organizing finances.Click <a href="https://www.coursera.org/articles/what-is-python-used-for-a-beginners-guide-to-using-python">here</a> to read more</li>
        <li>More specifically, Ruby is a scripting language designed for front- and back-end web development, as well as other similar applications. It’s a robust, dynamically typed, object-oriented language, with high-level syntax that makes programming with it feel almost like coding in English. In fact, some people feel that they can practically understand Ruby code before even learning how to program.Click <a href="https://developer.oracle.com/learn/technical-articles/what-is-ruby">here</a> to read more</li>
        <li>JavaScript is either embedded into a web page or else it’s included in a .js file. JavaScript is also a “client-side” language (rather than a “server-side” language), which is a fancy way of saying that it gets downloaded to site visitors’ computers, then processed.Click <a href="https://skillcrush.com/blog/javascript/">here</a> to read more</li>
      </ul>
